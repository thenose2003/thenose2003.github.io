# 🧾 M7 Speedrunning Rules

These rules apply to runs that will be marked as **legit** on this website.  
This does **not** guarantee that the runs are 100% cheat-free — it simply means they appear legit based on the evidence available.

We may introduce a future category requiring **5/5 POVs**, but since most players do not record full-party runs, it's currently unreasonable to enforce this.

Legit runs are judged **based on available POVs**. We can only make decisions using the evidence provided.

If a player is **undisputably caught cheating**, all previous runs including them will be **remarked as TAS**, unless that player provided the POV in question.

# 📌 General Rules

❌ **No cheats or unfair mods**. Disallowed mods include but are not limited to:
- Packet editing (e.g. stonk delay)
- Auto inputs (e.g. auto-terminals, SA terms)
- Hidden information (e.g. ESP, cheat minimaps)

🚫 **If it would get you banned on Hypixel, it's disqualified here.**  
Even if it's undetectable, if a Hypixel mod/admin would ban you for it, we will too.

✅ **Allowed mods** include cosmetic and QOL-only mods, such as:
- Skyblock Addons (SBA)
- Skytils
- Optifine

If you're not sure whether a mod is allowed, **ask first**.

📝 **Posters may also request their own run to be downgraded to TAS** if they no longer believe it meets legitimacy standards.
