I have played m7 for a while now, and it can be hard to keep track of all the runs and gamers and how they are doing. I wanted to consolidate some things in a way that was reasonable for me to read and such. Really the biggest thing is a place for me to try and track legit and cheated runs especially with how many runs are cheated in the modern day.
If you guys are interested in this at all please help vro I have no idea what I'm doing.
